  <p><h3>â€œIf you really want to do this with your life <br>
     you have to believe that you're necessary, and you are. <br>
     People want to live like this with their cars <br>
     The only reason people get to continue living like kings is because we've got our fingers on the scales and we're tipping in their favor.<br>
     and their big fucking houses they can't even pay for - then you're necessary. <br>
      I take my hand off, well then the whole world gets really fucking fair really fucking quick and nobody actually wants that. They say they do,<br>
       but they really don't. They want what we have to give but they also want to play innocent and pretend they have no idea where it actually came from;  <br>
       and that's more hypocrisy than I'm willing to swallow, so fuck 'em.
