  <p><h3>“Act as if! Act as if you're a wealthy man, rich already,
    and then you'll surely become rich.<br>
    Act as if you have unmatched confidence
    and then people will surely have confidence in you.<br>
     Act as if you have unmatched experience and then people will follow your advice.<br>
      And act as if you are already a tremendous success,
     and as sure as I stand here today - you will become successful."</h3>
